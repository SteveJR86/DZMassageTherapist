          Healer! I cannot thank you enough Damian. This was the best treatment massage I have ever
          had. Damian is very professional ,friendly and respectful. I felt super comfortable during
          my session. The atmosphere was amazing and super relaxing.
          I have tried a lot of different things to help with my back problems, but I can honestly
          say that only after my treatment with Damian I do feel like there has been a change in my
          body. There is  no pain, and I can finally stretch without feeling discomfort. He was able
          to locate  my painful spots without me having to show it to him, which astounded me! I will
          be back!

          Damian is a fantastic sports masseur. I am a musician and he has helped me enormously. He
          comes to you which is great and he is extremely knowledgeable and seems to just have the
          perfect depth of touch. He is also  a really genuine engaging man. I highly recommend him.

          The best massage I've had! Damian is very professional and pays attention to details. He
          has helped me with my stiff back and sports-related injuries. I can't recommend his
          services enough.

          One of the best massages I ever had! Damian understands my complicated medical and
          professional problems and how to deal with them. He is very respectful and sensitive, and
          explains exactly what he is doing! Highly recommend! I feel two inches taller after a
          treatment!

          I had a one hour deep tissue massage with Damian, it was by far the best massage I had in
          my life (and I had many). Damian is not only very technical, he also talks to you and tries
          understanding your true needs, beside the obvious pain-releasing ones. Highly recommended.

          Damian is a very friendly,  professional and knowledgeable  Therapist. He helped me with my
          back, shoulder and ankle injury. I highly  recommend not only his sport massage but also
          cupping, kinesiology taping and trigger point therapy.  I can't recommend him enough!
